Sphere Studio
=============

Sphere Studio is a powerful integrated development environment for the
[Sphere game platform](https://github.com/fatcerberus/neosphere) with a user
interface inspired by Visual Studio.  Originally developed by Andrew Helenius
as a drop-in replacement for the Sphere 1.x editor, Sphere Studio now supports
both Sphere v1 and v2 workflows out-of-the-box.

The Sphere Studio IDE includes a comprehensive set of editors for game
development, including a powerful code editor with Quick Find and Replace
support, map and spriteset editors, and more.  And single-step debugging is
supported when using neoSphere, allowing you to easily debug your game's
JavaScript code while it's running.

If you need additional functionality, the editor has a powerful plugin system
which allows new features to be added by writing a plugin in C# or VB.NET.
